Let's call a string good if and only if it consists of only two types of letters — 'a' and 'b' and every two consecutive letters are distinct. For example "baba" and "aba" are good strings and "abb" is a bad string.

You have a strings "a", b strings "b" and c strings "ab". You want to choose some subset of these strings and concatenate them in any arbitrarily order.

What is the length of the longest good string you can obtain this way?

Input
The first line contains three positive integers a, b, c (1≤a,b,c≤109) — the number of strings "a", "b" and "ab" respectively.

Output
Print a single number — the maximum possible length of the good string you can obtain.
